# reddit-visitor-scrape
Gather data points on the number of online visitors on a specific subreddit over a specified period of time.

## Background
Every subreddit displays the number of online visitors on that specific subreddit. It would be interesting to analyze the online visitor traffic for specific subreddits.

## Task
Create a python script to scrape the visitor info over a span of time. It would be easy to do this if you pull the HTML from the URL of the subreddit and parse out the information on the number of visitors.

Goal:
* Have a script that can be left running for a specified amount of time (choose your own default value)
* After that certain amount of time, give an organized visualization (table, i.e.) of the different number of visitors on the specific subreddit depending on the time of day/week/hr, etc.

## Extra
Use something like Jupyter to provide easy visualization of data. Maybe look up ways to integrate R with python? Try also exploring various python libraries to make webscraping easier (Selenium(?), i.e.).
